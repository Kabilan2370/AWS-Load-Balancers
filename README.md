# AWS-Load-Balancers
Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets and virtual appliances in one or more Availability Zones (AZs). 

# Creating a ALB through terraform....
# Application Load Balancer

  Application Load Balancer operates at the request level (layer 7), routing traffic to targets (EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions)
  based on the content of the request. Ideal for advanced load balancing of HTTP and HTTPS traffic, Application Load Balancer provides advanced request routing 
  targeted at delivery of modern application architectures, including microservices and container-based applications. Application Load Balancer simplifies and
  improves the security of your application, by ensuring that the latest SSL/TLS ciphers and protocols are used at all times.
